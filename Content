### **Day 1: IICS Architecture**
**Agenda:**
1. **Introduction to IICS:**
   - **Overview of IICS:** IICS (Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services) is a suite of cloud-based data management services. It enables organizations to integrate, manage, and transform data across cloud and on-premise environments.
   - **Key Features and Benefits:** IICS offers features like ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), data quality, application integration, API management, and data governance. It supports high scalability, flexibility, and ease of use.
   - **Role in Modern Data Management:** IICS plays a crucial role in helping organizations to leverage data for analytics, ensuring data quality and governance, and enabling seamless integration across various data sources.

2. **Architecture Overview:**
   - **Core Components:** IICS comprises several key components:
     - **Secure Agent:** A lightweight program installed on-premise or on cloud VMs that facilitates secure data integration between cloud and on-premise environments.
     - **Cloud Repository:** Stores metadata related to the integration jobs, mappings, and configurations.
     - **Services:** Various services like Data Integration, API Integration, and Data Quality that perform specific tasks within the IICS ecosystem.
   - **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** IICS operates on a multi-tenant architecture, meaning multiple customers (tenants) can share the same physical resources while keeping their data separate and secure.
   - **Data Flow within IICS:** The data flow typically involves extracting data from a source, transforming it according to business rules, and then loading it into a target system.
   - **Security and Compliance Considerations:** IICS includes various security features such as data encryption, access controls, and compliance with industry standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

3. **Deployment Models:**
   - **On-Premise vs Cloud-Based Deployment:** IICS can be deployed entirely in the cloud or in a hybrid setup where the Secure Agent runs on-premise to access local data.
   - **Hybrid Deployment Strategies:** Hybrid deployments allow for the flexibility of cloud services while keeping sensitive data on-premise.

4. **Use Cases:**
   - **Common Use Cases:** Examples include cloud data warehousing, real-time data integration, API management, and cross-application data synchronization.

### **Day 2: IICS Development Strategies and Reusable Components**
**Agenda:**
1. **Development Best Practices:**
   - **Modular Approach:** Break down complex data integration tasks into smaller, reusable modules. This improves maintainability and reusability.
   - **Parameterization:** Use parameters to make mappings and workflows more flexible. Parameters allow you to change values without modifying the underlying logic, which is crucial for reuse across different environments.
   - **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to capture and log errors during job execution. This ensures that issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

2. **Reusable Components:**
   - **Reusable Mappings and Workflows:** Create mappings and workflows that can be reused across different projects. For example, a reusable mapping might handle common data transformations or validations.
   - **Design Templates:** Develop templates for common tasks such as data cleansing or data migration. Templates save development time and ensure consistency.
   - **Template Designer in IICS:** The Template Designer tool in IICS allows developers to create and manage reusable components, which can be used as building blocks for other mappings.

3. **Performance Optimization:**
   - **Optimizing Jobs:** Optimize performance by tuning the data flow, using partitioning to parallelize tasks, and employing pushdown optimization to push processing to the database level where possible.
   - **Partitioning and Pushdown:** Partitioning divides data into smaller subsets for parallel processing, while pushdown optimization allows SQL transformations to be executed directly in the database.

4. **Version Control and Collaboration:**
   - **Version Control:** Use version control to track changes in mappings and workflows. This helps in maintaining different versions and allows rollbacks if needed.
   - **Collaborative Development:** Encourage collaborative development practices, such as code reviews and shared repositories, to improve code quality and team efficiency.

### **Day 3: GCP Architecture & GCP Cloud Storage**
**Agenda:**
1. **Introduction to GCP:**
   - **Overview of GCP:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search and YouTube.
   - **GCP’s Global Network:** GCP offers a global network of data centers, allowing users to run applications and store data with high availability and low latency.

2. **GCP Architecture:**
   - **Core Components:**
     - **Compute Engine:** GCP's IaaS service that provides virtual machines.
     - **Kubernetes Engine:** Managed Kubernetes service for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.
     - **Cloud Functions:** Serverless compute service that runs code in response to events.
   - **Network Architecture:** GCP’s network includes Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), Subnets, and Firewalls that secure and manage network traffic.
   - **Security in GCP:** GCP includes Identity and Access Management (IAM) for controlling access, encryption for data protection, and compliance with regulations like GDPR.

3. **GCP Cloud Storage:**
   - **Overview of Storage Options:**
     - **Cloud Storage:** Object storage for storing and retrieving any amount of data at any time.
     - **Persistent Disks:** Block storage for virtual machines.
     - **Filestore:** Managed file storage service.
   - **Storage Classes:**
     - **Standard:** High-performance storage for frequently accessed data.
     - **Nearline:** Low-cost storage for data that is accessed less than once a month.
     - **Coldline:** Even lower-cost storage for data accessed less than once a year.
     - **Archive:** Lowest cost, long-term storage.
   - **Best Practices:** Use lifecycle management to automate transitions between storage classes and enable versioning to retain previous versions of objects.

4. **Integration with Other Services:**
   - **Integration Examples:** Cloud Storage can be integrated with BigQuery for data analytics, Dataflow for data processing, and AI/ML services for data-driven insights.
   - **Real-World Use Cases:** Examples might include backups and archival, serving content globally, and storing big data for analytics.

### **Day 4: BQ Architecture and User Interaction**
**Agenda:**
1. **Introduction to BigQuery:**
   - **Overview of BigQuery:** BigQuery is Google’s fully-managed, serverless data warehouse that enables super-fast SQL queries using the processing power of Google's infrastructure.
